A Java implementation of structured outputs for multi-agent systems (OpenAI, ChatGPT).. The app sends a prompt to six unique GPTs, each contributing a distinct part to a combined six-part publication."

Using multiple GPTs, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the publication, allows for a more modular and specialized response. Each GPT can focus on a particular perspective or part, resulting in a richer and more diverse output. This division of labor ensures that each part is handled by an agent optimized for that type of content, potentially leading to higher quality and greater coherence across the final product. It also introduces the ability to parallelize the work, which can reduce the time needed to generate complex, multi-faceted publications. Additionally, structured outputs ensure consistency and a well-organized format, making the final product more cohesive and easier to integrate into broader workflows.
